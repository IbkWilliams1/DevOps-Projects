##  INITIALIZING A REPOSITORY AND MAKING COMMITS
### WHAT IS GIT?
Git is a type of version control system designed to monitor alterations made to your code, facilitating collaboration among developers. Prior to Git, alternative technologies like SVN addressed this issue, with Git taking a distinct approach. Unlike SVN, Git enables developers to create individual copies of the central repository, earning it the classification of a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS).

### INITIALIZING A GIT REPOSITORY
Before we can initialize a git repository, we must have installed git on our computer. After installing, to initialize a repo. We follow the below steps;

-   Open a terminal on the computer e.g Git bash; the default terminal after downloading and installing Git.

-   We open the terminal and create a working folder or directory e.g DevOps folder using this command ```mkdir DevOps.```

-   After creating the folder or directory, we'll have to change or move into the working directory using this command ```cd DevOps.```

-   While inside the folder/directory, we use the ```git init``` command to initialize our repository.
