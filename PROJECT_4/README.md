# WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LEMP STACK)
Project 4 covers similar concepts as Project 3 and helps to cement my skills of deploying Web solutions using LA(E)MP stacks.
This I have to, having successfully completed Project 3.

In this project you will be implementing a similar stack, but with an alternative Web Server - NGINX, which is also very popular and widely used by many websites in the Internet.

In order to complete this project I will also need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS.

So If you do not have an AWS account - go back to Project 3 Step 0 to sign in to AWS free tier account and create a new EC2 Instance of t2.micro family with Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (HVM) image. Remember, you can have multiple EC2 instances, but make sure you STOP the ones you are not working with at the moment to save available free hours.

Hint: In previous project I used termius on Windows to connect to my EC2 Instance, and I will aslo do the same here.

Download termius on your window machine and do the same.
